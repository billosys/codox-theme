# Superhero Codox Theme

*A Codox Theme for Bootswatch Superhero-themed Documentation*

This is a modern and responsive [codox][codox] theme developed for the BilloSystems [Timi application]() and based on the
[Clojang codox-theme](https://github.com/clojang/codox-theme/).

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/billosys/superhero-codox-theme.svg)](https://clojars.org/billosys/superhero-codox-theme)

Then set the following:

```clojure
:codox {:themes [:superhero]}
```

For syntax highlighting capabilities, you'll need to activate Markdown rendering
via:

```clojure
:codox {:metadata {:doc/format :markdown}
        :themes [:superhero]}
```
